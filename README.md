## Description ##

Create a "Mug Monday" custom post type using a Gutenberg template.  A default "Mug Monday" category is added to each post along with a default "coffee" tag; these are created with a description if they don't already exist.  The title filler text is automatically created in the format "Mug Monday #x - Week " where "x" is an automatically calculated mug number based on how many other posts are in the database.  This text is saved as the title if nothing else is entered.

## Installation ##
